### Hi, I'm Kamille

Almost everything important about my professional career can be found on [my website](https://kamillenorris.com/) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamille-norris-a37971a4/), so here I will instead share a couple fun facts.

* I originally got into web development from Myspace, the more glitter and clunky animations the better.
* I created my Github username in college with my original gamertag on the Xbox360 and never updated it to be "more professional."
* My (unrealistic) dream is to be the next Eric Barone.
