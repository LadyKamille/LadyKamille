### Hi, I'm Kamille ðŸ‘‹
Anyone else become a developer and suffer the curse of trying to use websites that were _probably_ okay before but drive you crazy now? What about when you started to learn about accessibility and realized that it's actually WAY worse for others? My journey of becoming a developer has had a primary focus on making intuitive and accessibile UIs built with empathy for the end user. It's what I love about my job; the ability to solve problems and make things easier for others.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Barista Training App! I love making coffee, but I hate losing track of all of the timing, grinds, and other associated factors to make great coffee. Tools: 
  - :hammer: A GraphQL API in Rails with an React Native Mobile Application
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rails, React Native, and Laravel. (I really want to check out Vue as well!)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any open source project. A goal of mine has been to help find and fix accessibility issues in component libraries.
